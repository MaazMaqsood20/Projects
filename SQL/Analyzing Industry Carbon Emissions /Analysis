When factoring heat generation required for the manufacturing and transportation of products, Greenhouse gas emissions attributable to products, from food to sneakers to appliances, make up more than 75% of global emissions. -The Carbon Catalogue

Our data, which is publicly available on nature.com, contains product carbon footprints (PCFs) for various companies. PCFs are the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to a given product, measured in CO2 (carbon dioxide equivalent).

This data is stored in a PostgreSQL database containing one table, prouduct_emissions, which looks at PCFs by product as well as the stage of production that these emissions occurred. Here's a snapshot of what product_emissions contains in each column:

| field                                | data type   |
|------------------------------------  |-------------|
| `id`                                 | `VARCHAR`   |
| `year`                               | `INT`       |
| `product_name`                       | `VARCHAR`   |
| `company`                            | `VARCHAR`   |
| `country`                            | `VARCHAR`   |
| `industry_group`                     | `VARCHAR`   |
| `weight_kg`                          | `NUMERIC`   |
| `carbon_footprint_pcf`               | `NUMERIC`   |
| `upstream_percent_total_pcf`         | `VARCHAR`   |
| `operations_percent_total_pcf`       | `VARCHAR`   |
| `downstream_percent_total_pcf`       | `VARCHAR`   |

Find the number of unique companies and their total carbon footprint PCF for each industry group, filtering for the most recent year in the database. The query should return three columns: industry_group, num_companies, and total_industry_footprint, with the last column being rounded to one decimal place. The results should be sorted by total_industry_footprint from highest to lowest values.

SELECT 
	industry_group,
	COUNT(DISTINCT company) AS num_companies,
	ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf),1) AS total_industry_footprint
FROM product_emissions
WHERE year IN (SELECT MAX(year)
			  FROM product_emissions) 
GROUP BY industry_group
ORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC;

Output:

industry_group	                    | num_companies  |	total_industry_footprint
Materials	                          |        3	     |          107129
